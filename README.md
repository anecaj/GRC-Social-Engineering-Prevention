# Behavioral Risk Integration in GRC Frameworks for Social Engineering Prevention

Research investigating how integrating behavioral risk metrics into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks can reduce social engineering incidents in enterprise operating systems.

## Overview

This project examines whether incorporating continuous behavioral simulations, OS-level monitoring, and machine learning analysis into traditional GRC frameworks can effectively reduce social engineering attack success rates. The research compares human-integrated GRC approaches against conventional technical-focused compliance methods.

## Key Findings

- **37.5% reduction** in social engineering incident rates
- Human-integrated GRC approach significantly outperforms traditional technical-only frameworks
- Behavioral monitoring combined with compliance frameworks creates measurable security improvements
- OS-level monitoring enables early detection of human-factor vulnerabilities

## Problem Statement

Traditional GRC frameworks focus primarily on technical controls (firewalls, patch management, encryption) while overlooking human behavior patterns. Since approximately 90% of successful breaches involve social engineering, this gap leaves organizations vulnerable despite strong technical postures.

## Proposed Solution

A human-integrated GRC framework that incorporates:
- Continuous behavioral simulations (phishing tests, social engineering scenarios)
- OS-level user behavior monitoring
- Machine learning analysis of user interaction patterns
- Real-time risk scoring based on behavioral indicators
- Adaptive security controls triggered by behavioral anomalies

## Methodology

- **Framework Analysis:** Comparative analysis of traditional vs. human-integrated GRC approaches
- **Research Type:** Quantitative analysis using simulated enterprise environments
- **Metrics Evaluated:** 
  - Social engineering incident success rates
  - Detection time for anomalous behavior
  - User risk profile accuracy
  - Response effectiveness

## Research Components

1. **Behavioral Risk Metrics** - Quantifying human security risk factors
2. **OS-Level Monitoring** - Tracking user interactions with enterprise systems
3. **Machine Learning Integration** - Pattern recognition for anomaly detection
4. **Compliance Mapping** - Aligning behavioral controls with existing frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

## Academic Context

This research was conducted as the final project for **Introduction to Operating Systems** at NYU Tandon School of Engineering (Fall 2025). The project explores the intersection of human factors, operating systems security, and organizational risk management.
